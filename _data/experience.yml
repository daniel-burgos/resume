  summary: During my time as a math teacher in the midst of the pandemic, I began my career by having a need for my technology intuition. I ran my 7th grade math class using the flipped classroom model, where I would record my lesson, upload it online to Blackboard, students would complete it asynchronously, and we would meet synchronously to sovle questions together and clarify misconceptions. I then transitioned to teach AP Computer Science where I covered computer science principles using a mix of pseudo code/Python. Out of my class of 10 students, 8 passed the AP exam, and 4 earned a 4 or above.
